# DispatchBase

Web application for managing transport services.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- PHP installed on your system (run `php -v` to check)
- Node.js and npm installed (run `node -v` and `npm -v` to check)

### Start the Project

1. Open a terminal and navigate to your project root:
   ```
   cd "C:\Users\baldd\OneDrive\Documents\Dispatch Base\Web Application\Repositories\dispatchbase"
   ```
2. Run the following command to start the PHP server and open the app in your browser:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   - This will start the PHP built-in server at `http://localhost:8000` and open `index.html` in your default browser.
   - The server serves files from the `public` directory.

### Accessing the Application
- Visit [http://localhost:8000/index.html](http://localhost:8000/index.html) in your browser.
- To test PHP, visit [http://localhost:8000/phpinfo.php](http://localhost:8000/phpinfo.php).

### Stopping the Server
- Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the PHP server.

### Notes
- Make sure your `.env` file is in the project root for database connectivity.
- For database errors, check `public/database/db_error.log`.
