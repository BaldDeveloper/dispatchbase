# Project Structure and Best Practices

## Directory Layout

- `/database/` (outside `public/`): Contains all backend PHP files for database access and business logic. **Never place sensitive PHP files inside the `public/` folder.**
- `/public/`: Contains only files that should be directly accessible by the web server (HTML, JS, CSS, and entry-point PHP files).
- `/public/assets/`: Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
- `/public/js/`: JavaScript files
- `/public/css/`: Stylesheets

## Database Files
- All PHP files for database access (e.g., `TransportData.php`, `CustomerData.php`, etc.) must be in `/database/`.
- Do not duplicate or move these files into `/public/database/`.

## Includes/Requires
- When including database files in PHP scripts under `/public/`, always use the correct relative path:
  ```php
  require_once __DIR__ . '/../database/TransportData.php';
  ```
- Never use paths that reference `/public/database/`.

## Migration Steps
- If any database files are found in `/public/database/`, move them to `/database/`.
- Update all PHP scripts in `/public/` to reference the correct path.

## Why?
- Keeping backend code outside the public folder prevents direct web access and improves security.
- Consistent structure avoids confusion and errors like undefined methods or duplicate classes.

## Troubleshooting
- If you get errors about undefined methods or missing classes, check for duplicate files and ensure all includes use the correct path.

## Centralized Validation Logic
- All server-side validation logic (e.g., email, phone number) must be placed in `/includes/validation.php`.
- Use the constants defined in `validation.php` (e.g., `EMAIL_PATTERN`, `PHONE_PATTERN`) for HTML `pattern` attributes in forms. Reference these constants directly in the form markup to ensure consistency between client and server validation.
- Use the functions in `validation.php` (e.g., `is_valid_email`, `is_valid_phone`) for server-side validation in all PHP scripts. Always call these functions from a dedicated validation function (e.g., `validate_customer_fields`) in each form handler.
- Always require/include `validation.php` in any PHP file that performs validation for consistency.
- Sanitize and trim all input values before validation.
- Display error messages returned from validation clearly above or near the form, and highlight invalid fields using Bootstrap classes (e.g., `is-invalid`).

## UI Consistency Guidelines

### Tables and Lists
- When adding a new table (for listing data), use the same HTML structure, Bootstrap classes, and output escaping as in `customer-list.php`.
- For paginated lists, **always use the same pagination logic, GET parameters, page size selector, and Bootstrap pagination bar as in `customer-list.php`**. This includes:
  - Calculating page, pageSize, offset, and totalPages in PHP
  - Fetching only the relevant records for the current page
  - Displaying a page size selector (`<select name="pageSize">`) and navigation bar
  - Ensuring the UI and code structure match `customer-list.php` for all list pages (e.g., transport-list.php, pouch-list.php, etc.)
- Always use `<table class="table table-bordered table-hover mb-0">` and wrap tables in a responsive `<div class="table-responsive">`.
- Escape all output using `htmlspecialchars()` to prevent XSS.

### Required Fields in Forms
- For every required field in any form, always display the message "Please fill out this field." using a Bootstrap `invalid-feedback` element directly below the field. This applies to all add/edit forms (e.g., customer-edit.php, transport-edit.php, etc.).
- Use the HTML5 `required` attribute for all required fields.
- Use the appropriate `pattern` attribute referencing validation constants for fields like email and phone.
- Ensure the error message is visible when the field is invalid, matching the pattern used in customer-edit.php and transport-edit.php.
- Maintain consistent styling and placement for required field messages across all forms in the project.
- When adding required fields to forms, use the same validation logic, error messaging, and field styling as in `customer-edit.php`.
- Display error messages clearly above or near the form.
- Highlight required fields and errors using Bootstrap classes (e.g., `is-invalid`, `text-danger`).
- Use server-side validation to check for required fields and display appropriate error messages.
- After a successful add, always clear all form fields and display a success message, so the form is ready for a new entry.

### Dropdowns
- Always include a default "Select" option as the first option in any new dropdown (`<select>`) added to the project. This option should have an empty value (`value=""`) and be selected by default when adding new records.
- The label should clearly indicate what is being selected (e.g., "Select Firm", "Select Gender").
- Ensure this is consistent for all dropdowns in add/edit forms, including those for locations, users, types, etc.
- When editing, pre-select the correct value if available; otherwise, default to the "Select" option.

## PHP Coding Standards

- Always define global/shared variables at the top of each PHP file to avoid undefined variable warnings and improve code clarity. For variables only used in a specific scope, define them near their usage.
- Follow consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for all identifiers.
- Write comments and PHPDoc blocks for all functions, classes, and complex code sections.
- Maintain consistent indentation and spacing throughout the code.
- Use `===` and `!==` for comparisons to avoid type juggling issues.
- Sanitize and validate all external inputs (e.g., GET/POST data, file uploads) to prevent security vulnerabilities.

**Always follow this structure and these UI guidelines for all future development.**

## Form Reset on Successful Add
- Whenever adding a new row to the data for any table (e.g., customer, coroner, transport, etc.), **clear all form fields after a successful add** so the form is ready for a new entry. This should be the default behavior unless explicitly told otherwise by the user.
- The success message should still be displayed after the add.
- This applies to all add forms in the project for consistency and improved user experience.
